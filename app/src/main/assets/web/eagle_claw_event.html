                 The rich legacy of SRISTI gets a new expression in manual robotics. Here is an event that stimulates minds to innovate themselves and practically realize their ideas to achieve new heights. As you all know about the Eagle, it has sharp visions and can achieve great heights, but, more importantly it has a strong pair of Claws which help them to snatch almost anything they want anytime. We have this manual competition which is all about the perfection and efficiency. Follow the path as fast as possible, clinch the objects and place them perfectly while maintaining a sheer control over the zipline and survive the atmosphere.
